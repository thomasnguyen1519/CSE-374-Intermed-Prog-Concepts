# Homework 3: readme 



To remove the extraneous URLs that were not part of the rankings, I implemented a combination of extra sed and egrep commands. After extracting the URLs, I piped the output to a sed command that replaced the extraneous URLs with the empty string but then this left over newline characters. I got rid of the newline characters by using a grep command that captured all the lines that began with a lowercase a-z character.
